#Language Translator

This repository uses Python backend and HavenOnDemand API OCR recognition and Translator Api

The main motive of this Project is to remove the language barrier so that your computer screen displays exactly what you understand

Language has always been a barrier for us humans to communicate ,
We through this App, want to make sure that it is no longer an issue,
that it is the thought that matters and not the method of convey
Because in a world consisiting of more than 8 Billion people speaking over a 6500 languages,
Where there exists 8 Billion thoughts, Language should not act as a hindrance

The basic function of the app is to replace all the text on the current monitor screen and translate and replace it on the screen itself
